## Description

This project contains three basic programming challenges written in JavaScript.  
They are designed to help understand conditionals, functions, and basic calculations.

##Challenges
. **Student Grade Generator**

- Prompts the user to enter marks between 0 and 100.
- Outputs a grade depending on the marks:
  - A → greater than 79
  - B → between 60 and 79
  - C → between 49 and 59
  - D → between 40 and 49
  - E → less than 40

2. **Speed Detector**
   - Takes the input of a car’s speed.
   - If speed is less than or equal to 70 → prints `"Ok"`.
   - For every 5 km/s above 70 → adds 1 demerit point.
   - If points exceed 12 → prints `"License suspended"`.
